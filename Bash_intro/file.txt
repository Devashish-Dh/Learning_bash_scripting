this is how i am able to use the ">" to send the output of this terminal to the file.txt file

the ">>" is how i am able to append any and all output of this terminal to the file.txt file

use the super+d to come out of this editor mode and send the output
apparently we can use break and continue the same way as in python/c++, yay!
